# **Hi, I'm Abdullah Ariyanto 👋**

I am a third-year Computer Science student at UNSW with a systems-architecture mindset that prioritises scalability, security, and clarity in engineering. My work focuses on building reliable, sustainable solutions rather than surface-level development.

I am driven by the intersection between technology and people, aiming to create systems that are genuinely useful and culturally meaningful. I develop projects with purpose, ensuring that what I build provides real value to those who use it.
